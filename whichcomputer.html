        <h3>PC or Mac?</h3>

        So which one PC or Mac? Are you looking for the ability to have a customizable OS and able to download many more programs and applications? Or are you an artist/designer and want to have an easy user interface, this is the place to go. Lets start out with the artists and designers, you guys get it easy because should get a Mac and there is only one place you can get it from. Or do you want a customizable OS well you have it a little bit harder. You first have to think what is my use if you are a gamer get one type of computer but if you are an average user, get a Dell or HP. So it depends what you want, which is good because it gives everyone a wide variety of choices for computers.
