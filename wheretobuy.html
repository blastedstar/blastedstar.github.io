        <h3>Where to buy?</h3>
        
        <pre>
        So you're ready to buy a computer, but you're probably asking yourself 
        where do I buy it and which is the best place to buy them. If you want an 
        Apple computer you are lucky because you can get it at <a href = "http://apple.com/mac/">Apple.</a> But what if 
        you wanted to get a Windows/PC computer? Well there are many places 
        you can buy them from like:
             </pre>
            <ul>
                <li><a href = "http://dell.com">Dell</a></li>
        <li><a href = "http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a></li>
        <li><a href = "http://alienware.com">Alienware</a></li>
              <li><a href = "http://hp.com">HP</a></li>  
                <li>And many more...</li>
            <p>
I gave you this whole list of places to buy them from but now which one do I choose? Well Dell, HP, and Microsoft and usually for computers to browse the internet , look though emails, and do small tasks. They do have some gaming computers but if you want a real gaming experience I recommend you buy an Alienware. They a little bit more pricey but for the performence they are great.
