       So you are all ready to buy your PC or Mac. Now how much money is it? And which one do I get? Most likely if you are choosing between a PC and Mac a Mac is probably going to more expensive for your requirements. So take note that if you are buying a Mac think to yourself, do you absolutely need a Mac for the things you're doing. If you don't really need it and you need something to check emails and browsing the web, Mac might not be the best choice. So you change your mind and want to go with PC, well you made it harder for yourself but cheaper. If you're not sure which place to get your PC from go to the Where to Buy tab.
